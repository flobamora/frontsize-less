frontsize
=========

It's a CSS front end framework written to make websites easy to read on every device and faster to be coded. It gives to the developer a solid base which can be used to build responsive layouts for websites or web apps.

Do you prefer a [SASS][sass] version?

Documentation is [in progress](https://github.com/ideatosrl/frontsize-less/wiki) and *far to be completed* but the best doc is the code itself, isn't it?

####Site notes

To run [Jekyll][jekyll] from terminal:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

When [Jekyll][jekyll] is up, the site can be tested locally to [0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000)
